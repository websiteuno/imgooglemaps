Although there are other JQuery plugins that enable a developer to integrate Google maps API into websites, I wanted to create a simpler implementation, one that did not have all the options, only the basics. I think that in most situations, a website owner only wants an end-user to be able to view the ownerâ€™s address and be able to map directions to that address. In addition, I wanted a plugin that displayed a map interface that is similar to what one would see on Google Maps (auto mode) while also giving the developer the ability to style their own interface (manual mode). This plugin will also display certain Google Map errors codes. In addition, this plugin will allow you to use Ajax to retrieve an address as well as Reverse Geocoding.
